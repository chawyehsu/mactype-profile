A [MacType](https://github.com/snowie2000/mactype) Profile using the XHei WP font family.
Designed for 100% screen scaling, i.e. non-HiDPI, by [Chawye Hsu](https://github.com/chawyehsu).

To use this profile by default, you'll need to install the `XHei WP` font family from the XHei 6th fonts:
> https://bbs.themex.net/showthread.php?t=16898387 ([Baidu Pan mirror](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1VKBnGvMHSgzofOe_rythuw) `hxma`)

If you don't want to install the fonts and don't want to use font substitutions,
then you can turn font substitutions off by setting `FontSubstitutes=0`. You can
still apply the other settings of this profile to the system font.

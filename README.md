A MacType Profile using the XHei WP font family. Designed for 100% screen scaling, by [Chawye Hsu](https://github.com/h404bi).

To use this profile, by default, you'll need to install the `XHei WP` font family from the XHei 6th fonts:

If you don't want to install the fonts and don't want to use font substitutions, then you can turn font substitutions off by setting `FontSubstitutes=0`. You can still apply the other settings of this profile to the system font.
